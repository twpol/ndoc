			<h3 class="dtH3">Creating a New Project and Adding Assemblies</h3>
			<p>
				If you use Visual Studio.NET as your development environment, the easiest way 
				to create a new NDoc project is to select the "New From Visual Studio" button 
				on the toolbar.
			</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<P>After browsing to your solution file, you will be asked to select a 
				configuration within the solution. This determines what assemblies (debug or 
				release versions) will be used to generate your documentation.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>

			<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
			<p>Once you select a configuration, the NDoc project designer will add all of the 
				managed assembly projects from that solution to your new NDoc project.</p>
			<P>If you don't use Visual Studio.NET, you can add assemblies to your project 
				either by browsing for them with the <STRONG>Add</STRONG> button, or dragging 
				them into the assembly list view directly from Window Explorer. Make sure that 
				you are generating XML documentation during your compiles. NDoc won't add 
				assemblies to a project if it can't find the correct XML documentation.</P>
			<h3 class="dtH3">Choosing a Documenter</h3>
			<p>NDoc ships with a number of different options for generating documentation for 
				your code. Each different format is referred to as a <STRONG>Documenter</STRONG>. 
				Each Documenter determines it own layout, formatting, and in some cases content 
				for the generated documentation.</p>
			<p>The two most popular documenters are the MSDN documenter, which generate 
				compiled CHM type documentation similar to MSDN online help, and the VS.NET 
				documenter, which generates compiled html help compatible with Visual 
				Studio.NET.</p>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>

			<P><STRONG class="fineprint">NDoc Documenters</STRONG></P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P>
			<P>All documenters share certain setting, such as what types of members to 
				document. Each documenter also has its own set of custom settings which you can 
				use to control the exact content of your documentation.</P>
			<P>For more details about configuring documenters, refer to the <A href="documenters.htm">
					Documenters section</A>.</P>
			<h3 class="dtH3">Building the Documentation</h3>
			<p>Once you've chosen a Documenter, and configured it to your liking, hit the Build 
				Button to create your documentation. As the project builds and compiles, you 
				will see build status in the Output Window at the bottom of the Designer 
				Screen, as well as in a progress indicator on the status bar.</p>
