			<h3 class="dtH3">Contribute to the Success of NDoc3</h3>
			<p>There are many ways you can become involved in the NDoc3 development effort.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Participating in the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ndoc3-users">
						ndoc3-users email list</a>
				is the easiest way to share your tips and tricks for using NDoc3 with other 
				users.
				<li>
					If you find bugs or have suggestions for new feature please use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36057&amp;atid=416079">
						NDoc3 tracker database</a>
				so that we can keep current with our user's needs.
				<li>
					If you have some time to spare, become part of the NDoc3 developer team. There 
					are plenty of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36057&amp;atid=416081">
						new features</a> we are working on implementing, and there are always bugs 
					to fix, and the more people we have working on NDoc3, the better it becomes. To 
					join the effort, contact one of the project admins via the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndoc3/">
						NDoc3 SourceForge foundry</a>, and we will get you set up.
				<LI>
					If you've implemented your own custom tags you can share your work with other 
					NDoc3 users via the <A href="contrib.htm">NDocContrib</A> collection.</LI>
			</ul>
			<p>Thanks for using NDoc3.</p>
