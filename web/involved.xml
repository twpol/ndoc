		<p>If you're using NDOC then you're probably a developer so if you find a bug you can fix it! We love that!</p>

		<p>But that's not the only way you can help. If you find any bugs or have any ideas for enhancements, please submit your reports to one of our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36057" title="Inspire us!">Trackers</a> on SourceForge. If we don't know about it, we can't fix it!</p>

		<p>If you're interested in discussing the future development of NDOC, feel free to join our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=36057">mailing lists</a>.</p>
