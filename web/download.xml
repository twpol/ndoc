		<p>Obviously, you're going to need Microsoft's .NET Framework SDK 
		installed on your machine. See 
		<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/howtoget.aspx" target="_blank">
		how to get it from Microsoft</a>, if you don't already have it.</p>

		<p>In order to compile the generated HTML files into a CHM file, 
		you're going to need the HTML Help Compiler (hhc.exe) which can 
		be found in Microsoft's 
		<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp" target="_blank">
		HTML Help Workshop</a>. If you've installed Visual Studio .NET 
		then you probably already have this (look for the 
		<a href="file:C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop\" target="_blank">
		C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop\</a> folder).</p>
		
		To integrate your class libraries documentation with the Visual 
		Studio .NET help content, your will also need the 
		<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwmscextendingnethelp.asp" target="_blank">
		Visual Studio .NET Help Integration Kit</a>.

		<p>To get the latest sources, check them out of 
		<a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>. Since this code is under active 
		development, it might not be in perfect working condition (even 
		though we try really hard not to check something in if it 
		doesn't work).</p>

		<p>For those of you who don't want to (or can't) use CVS but 
		still want the latest bits, we automatically archive the code 
		in CVS every morning at 3 AM (Pacific time, GMT-8) and make 
		it available for <a href="ndoc-nightly.zip">download</a>.</p>

		<p>If you'd rather use a more "stable" release, you can download 
		the <insert-latest-release /> release from SourceForge. 
		This release supports both the .NET Framework 1.0 and 1.1, and 
		has limited support for the <a href="http://go-mono.org" target="_blank">
		mono::</a> runtime.</p>

		<p>We also have a 
		<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=36057&amp;release_id=113611">
		web installer</a> which will download and install the latest 
		release of NDoc (runs only on the .NET Framework 1.1).</p>
