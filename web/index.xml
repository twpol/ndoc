	<title>NDOC (formerly DOC.NET)</title>
	<body>
		<p>NDoc merges the assemblies and XML documentation files produced by csc.exe and creates a compiled HTML Help file enabling you to browse your own libraries just like the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/cpref/html/cpref_start.asp" title="View the MSDN Library">.NET Framework Class Library</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The documentation generator uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL" title="XSL Transformations">XSLT</a> to produce the HTML. Future versions will make it possible to customize the XSLT to produce documentation with any desired look and feel.</p>
		
		<p>Download the latest release (<insert-latest-release />) and see the output for yourself. The latest sources are archived every morning at 3 A.M. and are also available for <a href="ndoc-nightly.zip" title="Download the nightly ZIP!">download</a> for those who like to live on the bleeding edge. If you find any bugs or have any ideas for enhancements, please submit your reports to one of our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36057" title="Inspire us!">Trackers</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The NDoc source code is freely available under a certified <a href="http://www.opensource.org/" title="Learn more about the Open Source Initiative">Open Source</a> license. We welcome everyone to use our software in the hopes that they can provide feedback, submit bug reports and fixes, or even join us as a developer!</p>
