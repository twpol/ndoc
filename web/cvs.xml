		<p>If you like living on the bleeding edge, feel free to check out the latest code as often as you like.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a directory to hold the project. (I use <code>C:\SourceForge\</code> but you can use whatever you want.)</li>
			<li>Download <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/dev/codewindow.html">CVS for Windows</a> and place <code>cvs.exe</code> in your new directory. (Be careful that you don't extract it to the cvsM-NN sub-directory or the batch file won't work.)</li>
			<li>Download the <a href="checkout.bat">checkout</a> batch file and place it in the same directory.</li>
			<li>Double-click the <code>checkout.bat</code> file and hit ENTER when prompted for your CVS password.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That's it! The solution can be found in the <code>ndoc\src</code> directory.</p>
