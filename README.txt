
NDoc3 (http://ndoc3.sourceforge.net)
====================================


NDoc3 generates class library documentation from .NET assemblies and 
the XML documentation files generated by the C# compiler (or an add-on 
tool for VB.NET).  NDoc uses add-on documenters to generate documentation 
in several different formats, including MSDN-style HTML Help files (.chm)
or HTML Help 2 format, and MSDN-online style web pages.

The NDoc3 source code is freely available under a certified Open Source 
license (see COPYING.txt). We welcome everyone to use our software in the hopes 
that they can provide feedback, submit bug reports and fixes, or even join us as
a developer!

Building NDoc3
-------------

*) Prerequisites

In order to successfully build NDoc3, you need to have the Html Help Compiler installed. To obtain the Html Help Compiler you need to install the Visual Studio 2005/2008 SDK.

*) Build using NAnt
You need a version of NAnt supporting NET 3.5 in order to build NDoc3

switch on the commandline and execute

  C:\ndoc3>nant.exe


*) Build using Visual Studio

You need VS2008 to build NDoc3 using Visual Studio. Open the solution file NDoc3.sln and
build the solution. If you get one or more error messages

   "Source File ".src\CommonAssemblyInfo.cs" could not be opened

please either do a build using NAnt first or simply rename the file ".\src\CommonAssemblyInfo.cs.template" to ".\src\CommonAssemblyInfo.cs"




Using NDoc
----------

A list of tags supported by the MSDN documenter can be found in the .\doc 
folder.

If you want to create a .CHM file and you don't have VS.NET installed then
you're going to need to download and install Microsoft's HTML Help
Workshop.

Start NDocGui.exe. You can add your assembly/doc files manually or import
them from a VS.NET .sln file. If this UI's not intuitive enough then feel
free to add a bug report to our project as described below.

You can also invoke NDoc from the command line. Try typing NDocConsole.exe
with no options to see how it's supposed to be used. This is great for 
automated builds.

After you build NDoc, you can load one of our example projects from the
examples directory. This should give you a good idea of what NDoc outputs.


Support
-------

Since this is an Open Source project which we work on in our spare time, you
won't be getting any support. But if you do find a bug or have a comment and
you post it to our mailing list or one of our trackers on SourceForge then
we'll try really hard to help you out. Some bugs have been fixed and features
added within meer hours. Others have taken a few weeks. (That's still faster
than most closed source products!)

You can subscribe to any of our mailing lists here:

http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=212352

You can submit a bug report or feature request here:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=212352

If you do submit something to our tracker, please make sure you're logged in
to SourceForge or leave your email address in the submission if you don't 
want a SourceForge account. That way we can can contact you for further 
questions or let you know when we fix whatever it is you need.


We love getting feedback so don't hesitate to contact us!
